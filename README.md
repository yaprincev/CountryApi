This application uses CountryApi (https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v3-all) 
There are 3 screens, the first is responsible for choosing region of countries (ChooseViewController) the second shows us a list of countries (ListViewController) and the last one shows detailed information about the selected country. I haven't add CoreData yet, but it'll be there soon
